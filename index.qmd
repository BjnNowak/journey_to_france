Have you ever **visited France** ?

Let's take a tour of the country together.

This is a map of **population density** in mainland France, using data from the [Global Human Settlement Layer project](https://human-settlement.emergency.copernicus.eu/).

**White lines** represent **regional boundaries**, <b><span style="color:#4C8B9D;background-color:white;">blue pixels</span></b> show the <b><span style="color:#4C8B9D;background-color:white;">most populated areas.</span></b> 

For example, here is the Île-de-France region, with **Paris** in the center.

But I also want to tell you about **another map of France.**[@cr-ift]{pan-to="0%,-20%" scale-by="0.5"}

This one is a map of the **number of pesticides applications** per year.[@cr-ift]{pan-to="0%,-20%" scale-by="0.5"}

[It was obtained](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.25.624818v1.full) by taking into account all fields declared to the Common Agricultural Policy, and applying an average number of treatments per crop and per region.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BjnNowak/TidyTuesday/refs/heads/main/img/workflow.png" width=100% title="Detail of pesticide application map creation: white lines represent field boundaries."></img>

<b><span style="color:#A63D41;background-color:white;">Red pixels</span></b> show the areas with the <b><span style="color:#A63D41;background-color:white;">highest number of pesticides applications</span></b>.
 
This is particularly the case in Northern France because of the **cultivation of industrial crops** (sugar beet, potatoes) which require a high number of treatmentst: potatoes receive around **20 pesticide applications** a year, compared with 3 for maize, for example.

...but also because of a higher number of treatments for a given crop in Northern France compared to other regions, as **illustrated below for soft winter wheat**.

```

This can be explained by more intensive farming systems and weather conditions that favor disease development in Northern France.

By combining the two maps, we obtain a map of the population's exposure to pesticides.[@cr-bivar]{pan-to="0%,-20%" scale-by="0.5"}

Let's take a close look at the legend.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BjnNowak/TidyTuesday/refs/heads/main/img/bivar_leg.png" width=100% title="Legend of the bivariate choropleth map."></img>

Approximately **25 % of the population** is exposed to one pesticide application or more per year less than 100m from their home.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BjnNowak/TidyTuesday/refs/heads/main/img/weepeople.png)

This figure varies greatly from region to region.

For example, in Brittany, over **45% of the population** is exposed to at least one pesticide application per year.[@cr-bivar]{pan-to="35%,10%" scale-by="2"}

Such a result can be explained by the proximity of housing to fields in this region, with many small urban areas intermingled with agricultural areas.

<big>But some people are **more sensitive** to pesticide exposure than others.</big>

Ten years ago, 28 pupils and their teacher at a school in the Bordeaux vineyards **experienced illness** when pesticides were sprayed near their playground.

<small>**Source** [Jérôme Jamet, France Info](https://www.francebleu.fr/infos/societe/pesticides-epandus-pres-d-une-ecole-il-y-a-10-ans-l-affaire-de-villeneuve-de-blaye-creait-un-electrochoc-national-6257276)</small>[@cr-bivar]{pan-to="25%,-35%" scale-by="2"}

Like potatoes, vines receive a large number of pesticide treatments (around 15 a year for Bordeaux vineyards, for example).

A few years earlier, pesticide use had been suspected in [the development of pediatric cancers in another commune of the same region](https://www.francebleu.fr/infos/sante-sciences/reunion-sur-les-liens-entre-cancers-d-enfants-et-pesticides-preignac-1442345057).

The [ensuing epidemiological study](https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/determinants-de-sante/exposition-a-des-substances-chimiques/pesticides/documents/rapport-synthese/investigation-d-une-suspicion-d-agregat-de-cancers-pediatriques-dans-une-commune-viticole-de-gironde.-juin-2013) highlighted the high level of wine-growing activity in the study area, with **pesticide spraying in the vicinity of the school**. 

The following map will allow you to explore the school's surroundings.
```{r}
#| warning: false

library(tidyverse)
library(leaflet)

school<-tibble(
  name="School of Preignac",
  latitude=44.582371652568646,
  longitude=-0.2980652457917351
)

leaflet(data=school)%>%
  addProviderTiles(
    providers$Esri.WorldImagery,
    options = providerTileOptions(opacity = 1)
  )%>%
  addTiles(options=providerTileOptions(opacity = 0.5))%>%
  addMarkers(~longitude,~latitude,popup = ~as.character(name), label =~as.character(name))
```

But in that case a [lack of data](https://www.sudouest.fr/environnement/pesticides/lien-entre-cancers-pediatriques-et-pesticides-sur-les-vignes-il-y-a-un-manque-de-donnees-disponibles-17439583.php) made it impossible to conclude on the link between pesticide use and pediatrics cancers.

We hope that the map of pesticide treatments in France that we have developed may help to elucidate this issue.[@cr-bivar]{pan-to="0%,-20%" scale-by="0.5"}

In fact, in the same way that we as we combined the map of pesticide applications with population density, this map can also be crossed with **the location of schools in the country** to create a map of pupils' exposure to pesticides. 

:::{#cr-schools}
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BjnNowak/TidyTuesday/refs/heads/main/img/schools.png)
:::

For example, here is a map of **the 1,663 schools exposed to more than 10 pesticide applications** per year.[@cr-schools]{pan-to="0%,-20%" scale-by="0.5"}

The Bordeaux wine-growing area is indeed one of the regions concerned.[@cr-schools]{pan-to="25%,-35%" scale-by="2"}

... as is the case for the Burgundy vineyards.[@cr-schools]{pan-to="-15%,-25%" scale-by="2"}

... but also in the field crop regions of northern France.[@cr-schools]{pan-to="-5%,35%" scale-by="2"}

Unfortunately, the youngest students are the most exposed to pesticides applications.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BjnNowak/TidyTuesday/refs/heads/main/img/schools_expo.png)[@cr-schools]{pan-to="0%,-20%" scale-by="0.5"}

This is due to the fact that **schools for the youngest children are scattered throughout the territories**, while **high schools are concentrated in the cities**.

Recent research has highlighted a potential harmful effect of pesticide treatments on children
</div>
<br><br><br>
<div class="joli">
In North America, [Frank (2024)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg0344) showed that the decrease of insect-eating bat populations led to an increase in insecticide treatments, which in turn has led to **an increase in infant mortality** in the affected regions.
</div>
<br><br><br>
<div class="joli">
Such research depend on reliable and accurate quantification of pesticide use.
